## Overview

### Description

I built this website to introduce myself and some of my work. Keeping this in mind, I tried to use design as a language and give the visitor a feeling of what I'm like as a person and as a developer even before they can navigate to the About page or the individual project pages.

Therefore, I allowed myself to be creative and playful in styling the webpage, using cheerful color combinations and subtle animations, to prove, in addition to my full-stack developer skills, my attention to detail and eye for design and pleasing aesthetics.

### Features

- animated, color-changing background
- carousel structure (sliding pages)
- individual project presentation pages
- fully responsive

### What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to learn a lot about the MERN stack. Developing the database was definitely a challenge, but one that pushed my skills to expand.

I was particularly happy to work on authentication, which was a first for me, but I found it fascinating.

I tried to dedicate equal attention to the front-end side of the project. I designed and styled the website myself, meaning to make it look as professional as possible -- like a store I could see myself buying from.

### Continued development

Here are some features I still plan to implement:

- a searchbar that allows to find both books and authors
- editing permission for administrators, so that they can edit book or author information directly on the website
