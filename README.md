### Description

I built this website to introduce myself and some of my work. Keeping this in mind, I tried to use design as a language and give the visitor a feeling of what I'm like as a person and as a developer even before they can navigate to the About page or the individual project pages.

Therefore, I allowed myself to be creative and playful in styling the webpage, using cheerful color combinations and subtle animations, to prove, in addition to my full-stack developer skills, my attention to detail and eye for design and pleasing aesthetics.

### Features

- animated, color-changing background
- carousel structure (sliding pages)
- individual project presentation pages
- fully responsive
